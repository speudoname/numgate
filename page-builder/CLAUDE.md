## Page Builder Component Guidelines

## UI/UX Design Standards - STRICT REQUIREMENTS
     - **USE NEOBRUTALISM.DEV EXCLUSIVELY**: For ALL UI components, use ONLY components from NeoBrutalism.dev
     - **NO CUSTOM COMPONENTS**: Do NOT create custom UI components or invent new designs
     - **STRICT ADHERENCE**: Every button, card, form, modal, and UI element MUST be from NeoBrutalism.dev
     - **FOLLOW THE GUIDE**: See ../NEOBRUTALISM_GUIDE.md for complete component list and usage
     - **COPY EXACT CODE**: Always copy component code exactly from neobrutalism.dev - no modifications
     - **CHECK FIRST**: Before implementing ANY UI, check if NeoBrutalism.dev has that component
     - **NO EXCEPTIONS**: This is a strict requirement - no custom styling or components allowed

## Implementation Process
     1. Visit https://www.neobrutalism.dev/components
     2. Find the component you need
     3. Copy the exact code from their documentation
     4. Place in components/ui/ directory
     5. Import and use without modifications
     6. If component doesn't exist, ask for alternatives - DON'T create custom
