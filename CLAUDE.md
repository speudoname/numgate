## Important Development Rules
     - **NEVER ASSUME**: Always align with the user before making implementation decisions
     - **ASK QUESTIONS**: When unclear about requirements, ask for clarification
     - **AMBIGUITY RULE**: When something is not clear and there's ~50/50 understanding, ALWAYS ask for clarification instead of guessing
     - **SLOW AND STEADY**: Build features incrementally and verify each step with the user
     - **CONFIRM APPROACH**: Before implementing, explain the approach and get approval

## üéì LESSONS LEARNED - CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE

### RLS (Row Level Security) Gotchas
**RLS is powerful but can break public routes!**

#### When RLS Breaks Things:
- Public routes (catch-all, subdomain lookup) can't read data with RLS enabled
- Solution: Use service key OR create public RLS policies for these specific cases
- Remember: Even "public" pages need to read tenant info from database

#### RLS Policy Syntax Rules:
- **SELECT/DELETE**: Use only `USING` clause (no `WITH CHECK`)
- **INSERT**: Use only `WITH CHECK` clause (no `USING`) 
- **UPDATE**: Use both `USING` (for read) and `WITH CHECK` (for write)
- **ALL**: Use both `USING` and `WITH CHECK`

Example:
```sql
-- ‚úÖ CORRECT for SELECT
CREATE POLICY "read_policy" ON table
  FOR SELECT USING (condition);

-- ‚úÖ CORRECT for INSERT  
CREATE POLICY "insert_policy" ON table
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (condition);

-- ‚úÖ CORRECT for UPDATE
CREATE POLICY "update_policy" ON table
  FOR UPDATE 
  USING (can_read_condition)
  WITH CHECK (can_write_condition);
```

### Service Key vs Anon Key Decision Tree:
```
Is it a public route (no auth)?
‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Does it need to read tenant/domain data?
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Use service key OR create public RLS policy
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Use anon key
‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Is it creating users/tenants?
    ‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Use service key (bypass RLS)
    ‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Use anon key (respect RLS)
```

### What Breaks When You Enable RLS:
1. **Subdomain resolution** - Can't lookup tenant by slug
2. **Public pages** - Can't read tenant info to serve content
3. **Domain verification** - Can't check if domain exists
4. **Catch-all routes** - Can't identify tenant

### How to Fix RLS Breaking Public Access:
1. Create public read policies for basic info
2. OR use service key for specific public lookups
3. Keep write operations restricted to authenticated users

## üîí CRITICAL SECURITY RULES - MUST FOLLOW

### Supabase Client Usage
**NEVER use service key (supabaseAdmin) unless absolutely necessary!**

#### When to use SERVICE KEY (supabaseAdmin):
- ONLY for user registration (creating new users/tenants)
- System migrations or setup scripts
- Background jobs that need to bypass RLS
- **Nothing else!**

#### When to use ANON KEY (supabase client):
- ALL tenant-scoped operations
- ALL user queries within their tenant
- ALL domain management
- ALL normal CRUD operations
- **This is the default - use this 99% of the time**

### Security Checklist for New Features:
1. ‚úÖ Use anon key with RLS (not service key)
2. ‚úÖ Validate ALL inputs with zod schemas from `/lib/validations/`
3. ‚úÖ Check tenant_id from JWT (never trust client)
4. ‚úÖ Ensure user belongs to tenant before any operation
5. ‚úÖ Never expose sensitive data in console.log
6. ‚úÖ Add rate limiting to public endpoints
7. ‚úÖ Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS
8. ‚úÖ Use parameterized queries (Supabase does this)

### Example of CORRECT implementation:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Uses anon key with RLS
import { createServerClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const tenantId = request.headers.get('x-tenant-id')
  
  // Use anon client - RLS will handle isolation
  const supabase = createServerClient()
  
  // This query is automatically filtered by RLS policies
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('custom_domains')
    .select('*')
    .eq('tenant_id', tenantId)
}
```

### Example of WRONG implementation:
```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG - Don't use service key for tenant operations!
import { supabaseAdmin } from '@/lib/supabase/server'

export async function GET() {
  // This bypasses RLS - security risk!
  const { data } = await supabaseAdmin
    .from('custom_domains')
    .select('*')
}
```

## UI/UX Design Standards - STRICT REQUIREMENTS
     - **USE NEOBRUTALISM.DEV EXCLUSIVELY**: For ALL UI components, use ONLY components from NeoBrutalism.dev
     - **NO CUSTOM COMPONENTS**: Do NOT create custom UI components or invent new designs
     - **STRICT ADHERENCE**: Every button, card, form, modal, and UI element MUST be from NeoBrutalism.dev
     - **FOLLOW THE GUIDE**: See NEOBRUTALISM_GUIDE.md for complete component list and usage
     - **COPY EXACT CODE**: Always copy component code exactly from neobrutalism.dev - no modifications
     - **CHECK FIRST**: Before implementing ANY UI, check if NeoBrutalism.dev has that component
     - **NO EXCEPTIONS**: This is a strict requirement - no custom styling or components allowed
