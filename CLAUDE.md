## Important Development Rules
     - **NEVER ASSUME**: Always align with the user before making implementation decisions
     - **ASK QUESTIONS**: When unclear about requirements, ask for clarification
     - **SLOW AND STEADY**: Build features incrementally and verify each step with the user
     - **CONFIRM APPROACH**: Before implementing, explain the approach and get approval

## UI/UX Design Standards - STRICT REQUIREMENTS
     - **USE NEOBRUTALISM.DEV EXCLUSIVELY**: For ALL dashboard and UI components, use ONLY components from NeoBrutalism.dev
     - **NO CUSTOM COMPONENTS**: Do NOT create custom UI components or invent new designs
     - **STRICT ADHERENCE**: Every button, card, form, modal, and UI element MUST be from NeoBrutalism.dev
     - **TAILWIND + NEOBRUTALISM**: Use Tailwind CSS classes as specified in NeoBrutalism.dev components
     - **CONSISTENCY**: All dashboard pages must maintain consistent NeoBrutalism aesthetic
     - **REFERENCE**: Always check neobrutalism.dev for component patterns before implementing any UI
     - **NO EXCEPTIONS**: This is a strict requirement - no deviations allowed
