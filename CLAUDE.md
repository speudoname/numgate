## Important Development Rules
     - **NEVER ASSUME**: Always align with the user before making implementation decisions
     - **ASK QUESTIONS**: When unclear about requirements, ask for clarification
     - **SLOW AND STEADY**: Build features incrementally and verify each step with the user
     - **CONFIRM APPROACH**: Before implementing, explain the approach and get approval

## UI/UX Design Standards - STRICT REQUIREMENTS
     - **USE NEOBRUTALISM.DEV EXCLUSIVELY**: For ALL UI components, use ONLY components from NeoBrutalism.dev
     - **NO CUSTOM COMPONENTS**: Do NOT create custom UI components or invent new designs
     - **STRICT ADHERENCE**: Every button, card, form, modal, and UI element MUST be from NeoBrutalism.dev
     - **FOLLOW THE GUIDE**: See NEOBRUTALISM_GUIDE.md for complete component list and usage
     - **COPY EXACT CODE**: Always copy component code exactly from neobrutalism.dev - no modifications
     - **CHECK FIRST**: Before implementing ANY UI, check if NeoBrutalism.dev has that component
     - **NO EXCEPTIONS**: This is a strict requirement - no custom styling or components allowed
