## Important Development Rules
     - **NEVER ASSUME**: Always align with the user before making implementation decisions
     - **ASK QUESTIONS**: When unclear about requirements, ask for clarification
     - **AMBIGUITY RULE**: When something is not clear and there's ~50/50 understanding, ALWAYS ask for clarification instead of guessing
     - **SLOW AND STEADY**: Build features incrementally and verify each step with the user
     - **CONFIRM APPROACH**: Before implementing, explain the approach and get approval

## üéì LESSONS LEARNED - CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE

### RLS (Row Level Security) - FINAL ARCHITECTURE DECISION
**IMPORTANT: Custom JWT cannot integrate with Supabase RLS due to infrastructure limitations**

#### Final Architecture (This is permanent, not temporary):
- We use custom JWT authentication (not Supabase Auth)
- Supabase doesn't pass custom headers to PostgreSQL for RLS
- **Solution**: Use service key with STRICT tenant filtering in all queries
- **Security**: Middleware validates JWT, then API routes filter by tenant_id
- This is a secure and common pattern for custom auth with Supabase

#### RLS Policy Syntax Rules:
- **SELECT/DELETE**: Use only `USING` clause (no `WITH CHECK`)
- **INSERT**: Use only `WITH CHECK` clause (no `USING`) 
- **UPDATE**: Use both `USING` (for read) and `WITH CHECK` (for write)
- **ALL**: Use both `USING` and `WITH CHECK`

Example:
```sql
-- ‚úÖ CORRECT for SELECT
CREATE POLICY "read_policy" ON table
  FOR SELECT USING (condition);

-- ‚úÖ CORRECT for INSERT  
CREATE POLICY "insert_policy" ON table
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (condition);

-- ‚úÖ CORRECT for UPDATE
CREATE POLICY "update_policy" ON table
  FOR UPDATE 
  USING (can_read_condition)
  WITH CHECK (can_write_condition);
```

### Service Key Usage Pattern (FINAL):
```
ALL ROUTES USE SERVICE KEY - This is our permanent architecture:
‚îú‚îÄ Auth routes (login/register) ‚Üí Service key (needs password_hash)
‚îú‚îÄ Public routes (homepage, tenant lookup) ‚Üí Service key (no auth context)
‚îú‚îÄ Authenticated API routes ‚Üí Service key with MANDATORY tenant filtering
‚îî‚îÄ ALWAYS: Filter every query by tenant_id

CRITICAL SECURITY RULE:
Every database query MUST include .eq('tenant_id', tenantId)
The only exceptions are:
- Login (user lookup by email)
- Registration (creating new tenant/user)
- Public tenant lookup (by domain/slug)
```

### What Breaks When You Enable RLS:
1. **Subdomain resolution** - Can't lookup tenant by slug
2. **Public pages** - Can't read tenant info to serve content
3. **Domain verification** - Can't check if domain exists
4. **Catch-all routes** - Can't identify tenant

### How to Fix RLS Breaking Public Access:
1. Create public read policies for basic info
2. OR use service key for specific public lookups
3. Keep write operations restricted to authenticated users

## üîí CRITICAL SECURITY RULES - MUST FOLLOW

### Supabase Client Usage - FINAL PATTERN
**We use custom JWT with service key - This is our permanent architecture**

#### When to use SERVICE KEY (supabaseAdmin) - Required For:
- User registration (creating new users/tenants)
- Login endpoint (needs password_hash access)
- Public routes (tenant lookup, homepage serving)
- **ALL authenticated routes** (with explicit tenant filtering)

#### Security Requirements (MANDATORY):
- ALWAYS filter by tenant_id explicitly in EVERY query
- ALWAYS validate JWT token before operations
- ALWAYS check user belongs to tenant
- NEVER trust client-provided tenant_id without verification
- NEVER query without .eq('tenant_id', tenantId)

#### Why This Pattern Is Secure:
- Middleware validates JWT before route handler runs
- Every query explicitly filters by validated tenant_id
- No cross-tenant data access possible
- Common pattern for custom auth with Supabase

### Security Checklist for New Features:
1. ‚úÖ Use service key with MANDATORY tenant filtering in EVERY query
2. ‚úÖ Validate ALL inputs with zod schemas from `/lib/validations/`
3. ‚úÖ Check tenant_id from JWT (never trust client)
4. ‚úÖ Ensure user belongs to tenant before any operation
5. ‚úÖ Never expose sensitive data in console.log (all cleaned up)
6. ‚úÖ Add rate limiting to public endpoints
7. ‚úÖ Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS
8. ‚úÖ Use parameterized queries (Supabase does this)
9. ‚úÖ NEVER make a query without .eq('tenant_id', tenantId)

### Example of CORRECT implementation (PERMANENT PATTERN):
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CURRENT - Service key with explicit tenant filtering
import { supabaseAdmin } from '@/lib/supabase/server'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // Validate auth first
  const tenantId = request.headers.get('x-tenant-id')
  const userId = request.headers.get('x-user-id')
  
  if (!tenantId || !userId) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
  }
  
  // Use service key BUT always filter by tenant_id
  const { data, error } = await supabaseAdmin
    .from('custom_domains')
    .select('*')
    .eq('tenant_id', tenantId) // CRITICAL: Always filter by tenant
}
```

### Example of WRONG implementation:
```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG - Service key without tenant filtering!
import { supabaseAdmin } from '@/lib/supabase/server'

export async function GET() {
  // DANGER: No tenant filtering - exposes all data!
  const { data } = await supabaseAdmin
    .from('custom_domains')
    .select('*')
}
```

## UI/UX Design Standards - STRICT REQUIREMENTS
     - **USE NEOBRUTALISM.DEV EXCLUSIVELY**: For ALL UI components, use ONLY components from NeoBrutalism.dev
     - **NO CUSTOM COMPONENTS**: Do NOT create custom UI components or invent new designs
     - **STRICT ADHERENCE**: Every button, card, form, modal, and UI element MUST be from NeoBrutalism.dev
     - **FOLLOW THE GUIDE**: See NEOBRUTALISM_GUIDE.md for complete component list and usage
     - **COPY EXACT CODE**: Always copy component code exactly from neobrutalism.dev - no modifications
     - **CHECK FIRST**: Before implementing ANY UI, check if NeoBrutalism.dev has that component
     - **NO EXCEPTIONS**: This is a strict requirement - no custom styling or components allowed
