## Important Development Rules
     - **NEVER ASSUME**: Always align with the user before making implementation decisions
     - **ASK QUESTIONS**: When unclear about requirements, ask for clarification
     - **SLOW AND STEADY**: Build features incrementally and verify each step with the user
     - **CONFIRM APPROACH**: Before implementing, explain the approach and get approval
